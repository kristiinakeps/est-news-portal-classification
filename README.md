This project is part of the LTAT.01.001 Natural language processing course in the University of Tartu.

The data for this project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYoLG5auyuCs0X09QUG84JoosMVihPTW/view?usp=sharing). (Note that we found a mistake in the original dataset, all articles from Uued Uudised contained the same three sentences about a Google advertisement, the clean data where those sentences are removed is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10j27H1s2CrdslKqLIWl7fQrM674p5c1h/view?usp=sharing))
